# task-management-application
This project is a Desktop-Based Task Scheduler developed in Python using Tkinter, integrated with a MySQL database to allow users to register, login, and manage tasks. The app supports task categorization, deadlines, priorities, and status tracking. Each task is linked to a user, making the system multi-user supported.
